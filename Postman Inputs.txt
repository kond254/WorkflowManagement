In the Process are 3 instances where the candidates are able to communicate with the Process. 
These tasks are:
	1. After the Interview date has been set.
		-Task description: "waiting for answers"
		-Task name: "waiting"
	2. After the candidates habe agreed to the interview date and now want to cancle the interview
		-Task description: "Waiting for first Interview to take place"
		-Task name: "waiting2"
	3. After the candidates have passed the Interview and now have to accapt or decline the job offer
		-Task descritpion: "waiting for answers"
		-Task name: "collectingAnswers"

In each of these task is a interrupting Timer boundary event which waits for a designated time where the candidates
can answer.
The candidate answers are simulated with postman. In the following are the postman details for task 1 to 3 described.

1.
{
    "name": "candidateInterviewDateAnswer",
    "correlationKey": "22517998138432092I10",
    "variables": "{\"InterviewAccepted\":true, \"CandidateID\": 177}"
}


The correlation key has to be copied from the running instance under Process ID. Futhermore the correlation key consists
of a fixed endpart so that the different candidate interactions in task 1 to 3 are expected and collected at the right task.
The endpart here is "2I10"
For the variables the "InterviewAccepted" can be either true or false. For the "CandidateID" the correct CandidateID has to 
be written there. You find the Candidate IDs under the variable "TopTenCandidatesIDs"

2. 
{
    "name": "candidateCancels",
    "correlationKey": "22517998139256562I16",
    "variables": "{\"CandidateID\" :220}"
}

As explained above the correlation key has to manually written here with the endpart "2I16" aswell as the correct "CandidateID"


3. 
{
    "name": "receiveAnswerFromCandidate",
    "correlationKey": "22517998139228432I15",
    "variables": "{\"JobAccepted\":true, \"CandidateID\" :207}"
}

See explaination for task 1. Endpart here is "2I15"
